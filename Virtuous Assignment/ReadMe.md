## Virtuous Take Home Assignment

Using MVC .Net EF I created a Web app using a code first approach. Upon initialization the app seeds 12 rows to Db. 

Within the app I have created two new pages. 

Donation Summaries provides a view of the Database fields as well as provides CRUD functionality. 

Donation Metrics provides four statistics related to the model and what has been stored. The first two are broad stroke statistics total donations to date and largest donation made. These are simple text statistics. The second two are both charts. One is a pie chart that show the distribution of donation types. The second is a vertical bar chart that shows sum of donations made each month.

Besides that there is various alterations made the the web app to provide a more user friendly experience.
